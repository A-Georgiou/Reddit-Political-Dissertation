## Reddit Political Analysis Dissertation Project

Political divide has taken a significant hold of social media. Dangerous echo chambers develop
in the advent of an ability to detect them. r/The_Donald was a 790,000-user right-wing
subreddit that became a haven for its followers before it was banned for racism and harassment
in June 2020 from the platform Reddit.

This project aimed to develop a machine learning model to classify the political orientation of
Reddit's commentary and communities, build a full-stack application that enables interaction
with the model and live data. Facilitating users to understand further how the platform works
through identifying echo chambers and political safe havens in the wake of the presidential
election.

The dissertation discusses the successful process of building the full-stack application,
including extraction of meaningful data, overcoming over-fitting in pre-trained language
models, creating a backend to host the model in the cloud, and a frontend that enables the
visualisation of these components.
